## Differences Planned:
1.  Want to be able to run from modules folder, rather than having to already have module folder created.
2.  Expanding package.json to include dependencies for linting, codesniffer, drupal coder, phpdoc generation, and more.
3.  Better functionality documentation within module function calls (and might include a couple more).
4.  We shall see...
